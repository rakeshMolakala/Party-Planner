# Party Planner

## Description

Planning a party? Who wouldnâ€™t like one? Invite your family, closed ones, friends, or colleagues from work by creating an invitation card within minutes from numerous digital templates. Get templates by entering the theme for the party and create an invitation card by simply choosing from various templates and edit it with your images, message, etc. to send it out to your contacts. After selecting the perfect invitation card, send the card to all your contacts who also use the app and they will be notified of this event. Friends or colleagues who received an invite can click on it to see the directions to the venue where the party is being held. Additional features like in-app reminders, organizer, suggestions (where people who have been invited can give the hosts suggestions about the party) are implemented.
